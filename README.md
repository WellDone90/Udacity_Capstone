# Capstone: Running exercise app

As a capstone project I implemented a exercise app for runner. Here you can track your running progress every day. The following features are implemented:
- Each user has his own exercises list
- You can update your exercises
- You can upload a photo of your body shape at each day or interesting locations you've seen at your run
- You can track distance, the time you took to run the distance and average speed you run

# Testing

You can find postman collection here
